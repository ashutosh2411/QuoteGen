Lydia Leena	I dream, your smile !
Lydia Leena	"I talked to her,
few seconds ago,
but, now...
she is no more mine
married the Nature !
yes, human life is like scattered water on the Earth."
Lydia Leena 	"I inhale loneliness,
in the garden of sweet soul..."
Ashutosh Upadhye	"His touch was agony
Every act a torment, torture
So was my existence"
Ashutosh Upadhye	"I was the mortified
A thousand times over
After violation"
Ashutosh Upadhye	"Cease his right to love
And her right to breathe too
For they don’t love like you"
Ashutosh Upadhye	"She nailed a smile to her face
For that was easier
Than the questions she faced"
Ashutosh Upadhye	"“How’re you?” “Not fine!""
“But you always are so happy?”
He smiled; again."
Ashutosh Upadhye	"Why do birds stay at the same place, 
despite being capable of flying;
flying anywhere on the earth? 
Why do I?"
Ashutosh Upadhye	"He summoned angels for rescue
Deserted they leave him
The demon’s embrace was warm"
